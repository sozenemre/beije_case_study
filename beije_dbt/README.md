### Beije dbt Project Overview (Summary)

This dbt project manages the entire transformation layer for the Beije Case ELT pipeline, utilizing a multi-layered Medallion Architecture within BigQuery to ensure data quality and optimized performance. The project structure segregates models into ODS (for initial cleaned raw data), DIM/FACT (for core analytical entities like customers and orders), and MART (for final BI-ready KPIs). All execution is orchestrated by Airflow, relying on a Service Account Key mounted via Docker volumes for secure access to the beije_analytics BigQuery dataset. Key technical choices include the use of Time Partitioning and Clustering for efficient data storage and query speed, and distinct incremental strategies—insert_overwrite for large ODS/FACT loads and merge for precise updates to Dimension tables—to minimize processing costs and runtime. Detailed logic and model relationships are maintained across the models/dim, models/fact, and models/marts directories, supporting a robust and traceable analytics foundation.
